# Language List

The following list of programming languages is the list of languages that
TermAdd currently supports. The code text to the right of each name shows the
path to the library transcribed for that language. After this is the most recent
version the language has been updated for. If you would like to see another
language be added to this list, you may make an issue on GitHub with the
"New Language" template. We try to keep languages as up-to-date as possible.

1. Python - `/py` - 0.0.1
